Sudoku Solver By: Omar Marouf (MrPrince22)
The project consists of C++ for actually solving the puzzle, and python script calling the c++ file to start automating the solution (for more, watch the attached video) 
- Make sure to have the following header files included in the C++ script:
* iostream
* vector

- Make sure to have the following libraries installed in the python script:
* os
* pyautogui
* subprocess


To run the project, do the following:
1- first compile the c++ script(without actually running it)
2- Run the Python script and enter the board row by row
3- Switch to the Sudoku.com website and put the cursor on the top left square, and wait for few seconds and it will be solved.
